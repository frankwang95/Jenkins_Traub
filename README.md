# Jenkins_Traub
Implementations of the Jenkins Traub polynomial complex root finding algorithm in multiple languages.

# Haskell
A rough implementation of Haskell is complete. The algorithm is working for "easy" polynomials but we are encountering issues with polynomial overflow. More work is needed to ensure reliable outcomes. To use, simply run jT on some complex list. Exact conventions for the representation of polynomial by complex lists are given in comments of the code.

# C
C implementation to come.
